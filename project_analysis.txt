# DQR Project Analysis

## Codebase Metrics

- **Core Rust Code**: ~1,400 lines (src directory)
- **Documentation**: ~900 lines (README files)
- **Tests and Examples**: ~200 lines (excluding validation tests)
- **Total Project Size**: ~2,500 lines of code and documentation

## Feature Breakdown

| Feature               | Lines of Code | % of Project | Complexity  |
|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Validation Engine     | ~500          | 20%          | High        |
| Rule Management       | ~200          | 8%           | Medium      |
| Caching System        | ~590          | 24%          | High        |
| API Implementation    | ~100          | 4%           | Medium      |
| Data Structures       | ~100          | 4%           | Low         |
| Tests                 | ~400          | 16%          | Medium      |
| Documentation         | ~610          | 24%          | Medium      |

## Development Effort Estimate

The project represents approximately 140-230 hours of development time, including:

- **Core Implementation**: 80-120 hours
- **Documentation and Examples**: 20-40 hours  
- **Testing**: 20-40 hours
- **Project Setup and Configuration**: 20-30 hours

## Cost Estimate

Based on typical developer rates:
- At $100/hour (mid-range US developer rate): $14,000-$23,000
- At $150/hour (senior US developer rate): $21,000-$34,500
- At $75/hour (mid-range global developer rate): $10,500-$17,250

## Value Provided

1. **Custom validation engine** with flexible rule system
2. **Performance optimizations** including caching system
3. **Comprehensive documentation** with examples
4. **Test suite** ensuring quality
5. **RESTful API** for integration with other systems

## Caching Implementation

The caching implementation (592 lines) represents approximately 24% of the total project code and would typically cost $3,500-$5,750 at a $100/hour rate. This is a significant feature that adds considerable value by improving performance and scalability.
