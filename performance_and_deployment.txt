# DQR Performance and Deployment Guide

## Performance Expectations at Scale

Based on the implementation, you can expect:

1. **Request Throughput**:
   - A single instance could likely handle 100-500 requests per second, depending on the complexity of validations and server hardware
   - The caching system will significantly improve this for repeated requests (potentially 5-10x better performance for cached validations)

2. **Latency**:
   - First-time validations: 10-50ms per request (depends on validation complexity)
   - Cached validations: 1-5ms per request
   - As rule count grows, initial latency may increase linearly if rules aren't indexed well

3. **Memory Usage**:
   - Base memory: ~20-50MB for the application itself
   - Cache memory: Will grow based on the number of unique validation patterns
   - With no cache limits implemented yet, memory usage could grow unbounded with enough unique requests

4. **Scaling Factors**:
   - Rule complexity and count: More rules = slower validation
   - Document size: Larger JSON documents take longer to validate
   - Cache hit ratio: Higher cache hits = better performance
   - Concurrent connections: Performance will degrade with very high concurrency

## Docker Containerization

Containerizing this application is recommended for several reasons:

1. **Deployment Benefits**:
   - Consistent environment across development, testing, and production
   - Easy deployment to any container orchestration service (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.)
   - Simple scaling by running multiple instances behind a load balancer

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a Dockerfile using Rust's official image as base
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize container size
   - Expose the correct port (default 8081)
   - Configure environment variables for customization

3. **Example Dockerfile**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage
   FROM rust:1.70 as builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN cargo build --release

   # Runtime stage
   FROM debian:bullseye-slim
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/dqr .
   COPY rules/ ./rules/
   
   # Set default environment variables
   ENV DQR_HOST=0.0.0.0
   ENV DQR_PORT=8081
   ENV DQR_RULES_PATH=rules/default.csv
   ENV RUST_LOG=info
   
   EXPOSE 8081
   CMD ["./dqr"]
   ```

4. **Orchestration Considerations**:
   - For high availability, run multiple replicas
   - Consider using a shared cache (Redis) for coordinated caching across instances
   - Use health checks via the `/health` endpoint
   - Configure appropriate resource limits based on expected load

5. **Production Enhancements**:
   - Add monitoring/observability (Prometheus metrics would be good to add)
   - Implement proper logging to a centralized system
   - Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) for SSL termination and rate limiting

## Scaling Strategies

As your validation needs grow, consider these scaling approaches:

1. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Increase CPU and memory for each instance
   - Most effective when cache hit ratio is high
   - Simpler to manage than horizontal scaling

2. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Add more container instances behind a load balancer
   - Requires shared caching implementation (Redis, Memcached)
   - Better for handling high concurrent loads

3. **Specialized Instances**:
   - Deploy instances optimized for specific validation journeys
   - Route requests based on journey/system parameters
   - Allows for better cache utilization per instance

4. **Future Optimizations**:
   - Implement batch validation endpoints for higher throughput
   - Add asynchronous validation for non-blocking operations
   - Consider rule compilation to further improve performance
